    The classes ``NeuralNetworkClassifier`` and ``NeuralNetworkRegressor`` has a new optional argument ``callback`` 
    with default value ``None``. If a ``Callable`` is passed as the value of ``callback`` instead, it will be used 
    to access the intermediate data during the optimization. Two parameter values are passed to the callback during 
    each evaluation: the weights for the objective function and the computed objective value.
    A new method ``get_objective`` is added to the class ``TrainableModel``, which is the parent class of 
    ``NeuralNetworkClassifier`` and ``NeuralNetworkRegressor``, which invokes the ``ObjectiveFunction.objective``
    and ``callback`` to return a custom ``objective`` function for the optimization.
