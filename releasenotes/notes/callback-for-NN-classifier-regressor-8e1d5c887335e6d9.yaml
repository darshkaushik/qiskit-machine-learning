    The class ``TrainableModel``, and its sub-classes ``NeuralNetworkClassifier``, ``NeuralNetworkRegressor``, ``VQR``, 
    ``VQC``, have a new optional argument ``callback``. It is a reference to a user's callback function that can access 
    the intermediate training data to track the optimization process. The default value is ``Nonee`` and returns ``None``.
    The callback function takes in two parameters: the weights for the objective function and the computed objective value.
    For iteration an optimizer invokes the callback and passes current weights and computed value of the objective function.
